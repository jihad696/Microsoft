                <p>A manic and impulsive criminal from Zaun, Jinx lives to wreak havoc without care
                    for the consequences. With an arsenal of deadly weapons, she unleashes the loudest blasts and
                    brightest explosions to leave a trail of mayhem and panic in her wake. Jinx despises boredom,
                    and gleefully brings her own chaotic brand of pandemonium wherever she goes.

                <p>is a character in the game League of Legends. She’s also a tough girl.
                    The Vi in Arcane is not quite the same as the one you know and love from LoL. She’s a little younger
                    and playing different roles
                    (though she still has her signature gauntlets eventually).But we’re working with what we’ve got
                    here: the common theme between Vi in Arc

                    I learned when I was about your age, boy. You see, power, real power doesn’t come to those who were
                    born strongest or fastest or smartest. No.
                    It comes to those who will do anything to achieve it."</p>
